/**


The LogEntry is compromised similar to the following structure:

[LOG ENTITY LEVEL 1] [LE L1] [LE L1]
       / \
      /   \
 [LE L2] [LE L2]
            \
             \
           [LE L3]

	   Two strategies can be used here:
	   1) Layer-by-layer: All L1 elements are scanned first, L2 later and L3 after that.
	   2) Recursive: First L1 element is scanned, First L2, First L3, return to second L2 etc


The advantage of 1) above is that a surface level scan can be done quite quickly and log format can be established if unknown.
The advantage of 2) is that the recursion will create several patterns which can be very useful for speeding up the parsing to follow.

I'll have to try both.
