/**

This needs to be a singleton factory.


There is three algorithms that will be used:

1) Known pattern(s) for the specific LogStream.
1.1) The pattern(s) is demarshalled from an XML file (or proplist) into a series of possible LogEntities.
1.2) The log is then iteravitely  analyzed by creating LogEntries containing data populated LogEntities
This forms a LogEntry. The LogEntry contains only a tree of seen LogEntitites.
1.3) The LogEntry is then used to update the probabilities in the possible LogEntitites tree
-- The idea behind this is that the ParserUtil can be asked at certain intervals for the adjusted probabilities
and an updated marshalled XML pattern can be stored for future use.

2) Unknown patterns in the LogStream
This process is much more involved and needs a fairly big chunk of log to work on.
2.1) A Level 1 LogEntity is created. It has GenericCharacterDelimiter assigned to it which is loaded with a set of delimiter pairs

Some ideas:

Stream everything, even local files using an NSData buffer. If net protocol used is not file:/// allow for local buffering of stream and use this for peeking back
Implement a bundle manager for Parsers and DelimiterHandlers.
