GSLogAnalyzer has the intention to provide tools for analyzing log files and log streams via an reusable framework where logSinks (backends) and logProcessors (analyzers) are decoupled and provided as bundles.
The initial phase will consist of a GNUstep/Cocoa framework and a set of basic tools also developed using GNUstep/Cocoa.
